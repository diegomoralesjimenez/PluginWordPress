# Plugin For WordPress

I have created the two requested plugins and the FrontEnd page. I tested both plugins in a local environment both of them worked successfully

## Back-End Test 1 - Character Plugin

### Description

Plugin to update post meta and retrieve data from Thrones API for Character posts.

### Instructions

1. To add a new character, navigate to the Character post type and click on "Add New".
2. Enter the character ID for the desired character.
3. Once the character ID is added, the title and featured image will be fetched from the API.

## Back-End Test 2 - "Competitions" & "Entries"

### Description

In this plugin, you will be able to create a list of competitions and add entries for each competition.

### Instructions

1. Create a new page and insert the following shortcode to display the list of competitions: `[competitions_list]`.
2. Create a new page titled "Submit Entry" and add the shortcode `[entry_form]` to display the entry submission form.
3. Once the competitions list is added, you will be able to view the competitions page where the shortcode is located. You can see their Title, Description, and Image.
4. To add entries, navigate to the page where you added the competitions list shortcode. Click on the desired competition and then click on "Submit Entry" to add it correctly.
5. After completing the previous step, you will be able to see the entry in the Entries post type within the WordPress Backend.

## FrontEnd - "Travelopia"

I based my design on the homepage you guys have!

Please follow the instructions above to add a character using the plugin. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
